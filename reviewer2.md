Dear Reviwer,

Thanks for your valuable feedback. We are happy to see that you find our method **is effective for fast-moving instances**, **can work for uncommon instances**, and that you praise our paper for being good enough for acceptance.

**Comment**: Although the relative gain compared with previous method is high, the overall performance for open-vocabulary video instance segmentation remains low.

**Response**: 


We acknowledge the current performance limitations on the BURST dataset using the base-novel evaluation protocol. Open-vocabulary video instance segmentation is challenging due to unpredictable object categories.

Our method's approach of aligning visual instances before text alignment shows promise, as demonstrated by relative performance gains. We are actively working to improve overall performance by exploring enhanced representation techniques and using more diverse training datasets. We are also looking into better text alignment methods to capture semantic details more effectively.

We are committed to making further advancements and appreciate your support in accepting our paper. Thank you for your insights.
